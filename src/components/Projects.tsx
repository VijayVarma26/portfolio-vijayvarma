      "Developed an LLM-based crawler to extract and generate 110K+ verified business leads, increasing outreach efficiency by 12% in a quarter.",
    image: AiWebCrawlerImage,
    details:
      "This solution used Python-based scraping combined with GPT-4 Turbo via Promptflow to extract structured lead data from company websites, business directories, and global databases. Leads were filtered using vector similarity (OpenAI embeddings) and scored for quality. All data was stored in CosmosDB, and QA teams could monitor results via a React-based internal dashboard. The system ran on a CRON schedule, orchestrated via AKS and Azure Functions, supporting periodic refresh and deduplication routines.",

      "Reduced IPO deal processing time from 2.5 hours to under 3 minutes using LLM automation integrated with Azure infrastructure.",
    image: EcmIpoImage,
    details:
      "Built a Promptflow-based pipeline to extract structured fields from unstructured ECM IPO documents (emails, PDFs). Used GPT-4 Turbo with robust prompt engineering and schema validation (via Pydantic) to ensure data integrity. The solution pushed extracted data to Dealogic through a FastAPI microservice hosted on AKS. Implemented a RAG-enhanced fallback with PostgreSQL to handle edge cases and model limitations, achieving over 97% data accuracy across 500+ real-world IPOs.",

    image: "/images/league-table.jpg",
    details:
      "This PySpark-based pipeline was developed on Azure Databricks to align fields across large datasets with financial and deal metadata. Data sources included SharePoint dumps and MariaDB tables. The pipeline added multi-level validation logic, schema reconciliation, and delta-based change tracking. League Table positions were updated live, improving visibility for 2M+ advisors and 4.3M+ individuals. The solution integrated CI/CD using GitHub Actions and published data to dashboards and reports consumed company-wide.",

    details:
      "Designed and deployed a distributed web crawler system to aggregate data from sources such as OFAC, Interpol, SEC, and EU Sanctions lists. Used Selenium and Python scripts within Azure Databricks to perform scraping, cleaning, and enrichment. The processed data was stored in MySQL and blob storage, while the front-end alert system used Azure App Insights and Logic Apps to notify compliance analysts of critical matches. Reduced manual KYC review effort by 400+ hours per week and improved compliance latency.",
